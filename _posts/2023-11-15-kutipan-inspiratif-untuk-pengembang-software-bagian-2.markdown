Di blog ini, kami mengumpulkan kata-kata inspiratif dalam bahasa Inggris yang kami anggap 
bijaksana dan masih dapat diterapkan. Kutipan kata-kata ini dari orang-orang yang terkenal dan 
diterima di berbagai bidang industri software. 

Pada bagian-2 ini akan diambil dari: Betsy Beyer, Bill Gates, Bram Cohen, Brian Foote, Brian P. Hogan, Bruce Schneier,
Bjarne Stroustrup, Bob Frankston, Boris Beizer, Butler Lampson.

**Betsy Beyer** (*Technical author at Google*)

> "A key principle of any effective software engineering, not only reliability-oriented engineering, simplicity is a quality that, once lost, can be extraordinarily difficult to recapture."


**Bill Gates** (*The founder of Microsoft*)

> "Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight."
>
> "I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it."
>
> "If you ever talk to a great programmer, you’ll find they know their tools like an artist knows their paintbrushes."
>
> "I still think that one of the finest tests of programming ability is to hand the programmer about 30 pages of code and see how quickly he can read through and understand it."
>
> "Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose."


**Bram Cohen** (*The creator of BitTorrent*)

> "The mark of a mature programmer is willingness to throw out code you spent time on when you realize it’s pointless."


**Brian Foote** (*A researcher and software developer with more than 20 years of experience, in particular, specializing in reusable objects, frames, and patterns, and expanding the use of the 'big ball of mud' concept*)

> "If you think good architecture is expensive, try bad architecture."


**Brian P. Hogan** (*A software developer, editor, and author of technical books such as “Small, Sharp Software Tools,” “Exercises for Programmers”, “tmux: Productive Mouse-Free Development*)

> "Periodic reminder that the tech stack you use to ship a product only matters to other devs. End users only care that it’s fast enough and does enough to let them get work done. That is your top priority as a dev. Ship working maintainable things that solve people’s problems."
> 
> "Don’t decide on the tech you’re gonna use before you understand the project and the customer’s needs."


**Bruce Schneier** (*An American cryptographer, computer security professional, privacy specialist, and author of several books on general security and computer security*)

> "Technical problems can be remediated. A dishonest corporate culture is much harder to fix."


**Bjarne Stroustrup** (*A computer scientist and the creator of C ++*)

> "The most fundamental problem in software development is complexity. There is only one basic way of dealing with complexity: divide and conquer."
>
> "It (software development) is not and will not be reduced to a simple mechanical “assembly line” process. Creativity, engineering principles, and evolutionary change are needed to create a satisfactory large system."
>
> "An organization that treats its programmers as morons will soon have programmers that are willing and able to act like morons only."
>
> "Maybe ‘just one little global variable’ isn’t too unmanageable, but that style leads to code that is useless except to its original programmer."


**Bob Frankston** (*A MIT graduate computer scientist, co-creator of the VisiCalc spreadsheet program and co-founder of the software company that developed it*)

> "Reusing pieces of code is like picking off sentences from other people’s stories and trying to make a magazine article."
>
> "If you cannot explain a program to yourself, the chance of the computer getting it right is pretty small."


**Boris Beizer** (*An American software engineer and author*)

> "Blaming programmers has been the prevailing approach for a half century of software development: It has not solved the problem yet, so it is time to look in different directions."


**Butler Lampson** (*An American computer scientist best known for his contributions to the development and implementation of distributed personal computing*)

> "Everything should be made as simple as possible. But to do that you have to master complexity."
>
> "Some people are good programmers because they can handle many more details than most people. But there are a lot of disadvantages in selecting programmers for that reason — it can result in programs that no one else can maintain."

**Pamela Zave** (*An American computer scientist, known for his work on software requirements engineering, telecommunications services, protocol modeling, and validation. Currently working on network architecture at Princeton University*)
> "The purpose of software engineering is to control complexity, not to create it."


**Patrick Collison** (*Irish entrepreneur and co-founder of Stripe.*)
> "Programming is full of odd ideas. Using shorter, less descriptive names often produces code that’s more readable overall. The most powerful languages usually have far fewer concepts than the lesser ones. And failing may be the best way to produce successful and original work."


**Patrick McKenzie** (*A software engineer and entrepreneur, has many articles on programming and software marketing*)
> "Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it."


**Paul Butcher** (*Started his career writing games for 8-bit home computers before he was a teenager, and since then has worked in diverse fields at all levels of abstraction, from microcode on bit-slice processors to high-level declarative programming, is the author of “Debug It!”*)
> "Bug fixing often uncovers opportunities for refactoring. The very fact that you’re working with code that contains a bug indicates that there is a chance that it could be clearer or better structured."


**Paul Graham** (*He is an American computer scientist, entrepreneur and author.*)
> "When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compound bugs.  Compound bugs are two separate bugs that interact:  you trip going downstairs, and when you reach for the handrail it comes off in your hand."
>
> "A programming language is for thinking about programs, not for expressing programs you’ve already thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen."
>
> "If you look inside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too. I’m not claiming I write great software, but I know that when it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me crazy to see code that’s badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names."
> 
> "As for building something users love, here are some general tips. Start by making something clean and simple that you would want to use yourself."
>
> "You have to be able to see things from the user’s point of view."
>
> "Design and research are aiming for the same destination, just approaching it from different directions."


**Pearl Zhu** (*A software developer and author.*)
> "One of the reasons to see improved productivity in Agile is because of the simplicity principle."


**Peter Roizen** (*A Canadian software developer, game creator and entrepreneur.*)
> "I’ve seen many intelligent people who are just not practical. They get lost pursuing some academic goal that is totally useless. Being practical is important to good programming. You must be able to guess accurately how long it will take to complete a project, have the ability to calculate what can and cannot be done in that time, and then do it, resisting the temptation to go off and do other things. Practicality is important when you’re trying to make every piece of work the best because you always have a limited amount of time to work on it. It’s easy to triple the time to complete a project when you’re consumed with making it the ultimate in elegance."


**Radia Perlman** (*An American computer programmer and network engineer, mostly known for her invention of the spanning-tree protocol (STP) and known as the “mother of the internet”, has made extensive contributions to many other areas of network design and standardization*)
> "The world would be a better place if more engineers, like me, hated technology. The stuff I design, if I’m successful, nobody will ever notice. Things will just work, and will be self-managing."


**Ralph Johnson** (*A computer science researcher, one of the authors of the book “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software”*)
> "Before software can be reusable, it first has to be usable."


**Rasmus Lerdorf** (*The creator of PHP programming language*)
> "PHP is about as exciting as your toothbrush. You use it every day, it does the job, it is a simple tool, so what? Who would want to read about toothbrushes?"


**Ray Ozzie** (*Former Microsoft CTO, a software architect, and entrepreneur*)
> "Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration."
>
> "Bugs are often characteristic of a bad interface between subsystems, which is frequently a result of inadequate communication among people when they design the subsystems. When a bug is found, there is a tendency to handle it within the subsystem and not look at the program as a whole."


**Rebecca Parsons** (*American computer science professor and Chief Technology Officer of ThoughtWorks.*)
> "It’s never too early to think about performance."


**Richard Dalton** (*An experienced Irish software developer, trainer, and mentor*)
> "Teams are immutable. Every time someone leaves, or joins, you have a new team, not a changed team."


**Richard Kenneth Eng** (*A Canadian software developer with 30+ years of software and programming experience in a wide range of languages and fields*)
> "Simple, elegant languages remove the cognitive burden that afflicts users of more complex languages, so the theory goes. Programmers can be more productive and not waste time overcoming a substantive learning curve."


**Richard Monson-Haefel** (*A senior software engineer, independent consultant, publishes books for O’Reilly and Pluralsight*)
> "You don‘t drive the architecture, the requirements do."
>
> "Design is a discovery process, as we implement we discover new information, often impossible to know up front."


**Richard E. Pattis** (*A professor of computer science, the creator of Karel programming language, currently teaching introductory programming and data structures at the University of California*)
> "When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code."
>
> "Code should run as fast as necessary, but no faster; something important is always traded away to increase speed."
>
> "If you cannot grok the overall structure of a program while taking a shower, you are not ready to code it."
> 
> "The structure of a software system provides the ecology in which code is born, matures, and dies. A well-designed habitat allows for the successful evolution of all the components needed in a software system."


**Richard Stallman** (*An American free software activist and programmer.*)
> "Creativity can be a social contribution, but only in so far as society is free to use the results."


**Rick Lemons** (*A software consultant working on software analysis, architecture, application, and management for 20+ years*)
> "Don’t make the user provide information that the system already knows."


**Rob Pike** (*A Canadian programmer and author.*)
> "Data dominates. If you’ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming."


**Robert C. Martin** (*An American software engineer and instructor, popularly referred as “Uncle Bob”, best known for being one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, the author of the book “The Clean Code”, and for developing several software design principles such as S.O.L.I.D.*)
> "[Most managers] may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that’s their job. It’s your job to defend the code with equal passion."
>
> "Slaves are not allowed to say no. Laborers may be hesitant to say no. But. professionals are expected to say no. It’s the only way you can really get anything done.”"
> 
> "Don’t be afraid to make a name long. A long descriptive name is better than a short enigmatic name. A long descriptive name is better than a long descriptive comment."
> 
> "It is not the language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that make the language appear simple."
>
> "Agile is not about going faster. Agile is about destroying hope. The data produced by a good agile team provides a cold dose of reality to the managers — in time for them to — manage."
> 
> "In the last three decades we have irrevocably moved software into the very foundations of our civilization. We programmers now bear an awe inducing responsibility. Civilization is now ours to improve or destroy."
>
> "Every time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of expression."
>
> "The first concern of the architect is to make sure that the house is usable — not to ensure that the house is made of bricks."
>
> "Good architecture makes the system easy to understand, easy to develop, easy to maintain, and easy to deploy."
>
> "Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code."


**Robert D. Schneider** (*Specialized in big data, data analytics, database technologies, and cloud, has six published books and numerous articles, attends technology events worldwide as a speaker and presenter*)
> "While it is a known fact that programmers never make mistakes, it is still a good idea to humor the users by checking for errors at critical points in your program."


**Robert X. Cringely** (*The pseudonym Mark Stephens used for publishing his books and articles on technology in publications such as InfoWorld, Forbes, Newsweek, Success, The New York Times, Upside, Worth and producing the NerdTV internet program*)
> "If the automobile had followed the same development as the computer, a Rolls Royce would today cost $100 and get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year killing everyone inside."


**Roedy Green** (*A Canadian programmer, software consultant, and activist, known on the Internet for his “Java and Internet Dictionary”*)
> "The cardinal rule of writing unmaintainable code is to specify each fact in as many places as possible and in as many ways as possible."


**Ron Jeffries** (*One of the creators of Extreme Programming, an Agile software development methodology*)
> "Code never lies, comments sometimes do."


**Sam Altman** (*An American entrepreneur, investor, programmer, and blogger, best known as the CEO of OpenAI and former president of Y Combinator*)
> "Great execution is at least 10 times more important and a 100 times harder than a good idea."


**Sandro Mancuso** (*British software developer, founder and author of the London Software Craftsmanship Community (LSCC).*)
> "Contributing to open source projects is a great way to practice."


**Sidney Markowitz** (*A MIT graduate computer scientist with 30+ years of experience as a software developer, open-source and free software advocate, and has a Ph.D. in bioinformatics*)
> "The software isn’t finished until the last user is dead."


**Stephen Hawking** (*A world-renowned British theoretical physicist, cosmologist, writer, was a research director at the Theoretical Cosmology Center at Cambridge University in his recent years*)
> "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge."


**Steve Jobs** (*American business magnate, industrial designer and founder of Apple.*)
> "You can’t just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they’ll want something new."


**Steve McConnell** (*A computer engineer and the author of books such as “Code Complete”, “Rapid Development” and “Software Estimation” that left their mark on the history of software*)
> "Good code is its own best documentation. As you’re about to add a comment, ask yourself, ‘How can I improve the code so that this comment isn’t needed?"
>
> "Programming requires more concentration than other activities. It’s the reason programmers get upset about ‘quick interruptions’ – such interruptions are tantamount to asking a juggler to keep three balls in the air and hold your groceries at the same time."
>
> "Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often. If you want to improve your software, don’t test more; develop better."
>
> "In software, the chain isn’t as strong as its weakest link; it’s as weak as all the weak links multiplied together."
>
> "The big optimizations come from refining the high-level design, not the individual routines."
>
> "Once you start coding, you get emotionally involved with your code and it becomes harder to throw away a bad design and start over."
>
> "It’s hard enough to find an error in your code when you’re looking for it; it’s even harder when you’ve assumed your code is error-free."
>
> "There are no secrets on a successful software project. Both good and bad news must be able to move up and down the ptoject hierarchy without restriction."
>
> "Software projects fail for one of two general reasons: the project team lacks the knowledge to conduct a software project successfully, or the project team lacks the resolve to conduct a project effectively."
>
> "A good estimate is an estimate that provides a clear enough view of the project reality to allow the project leadership to make good decisions about how to control the project to hit its targets."
>
> "The default movement on a software project should be in the direction of taking elements of the software away to make it simpler rather than adding elements to make it more complex."
>
> "Motivation is undoubtedly the single greatest influence on how well people perform."


**Steve Swartz** (*A software development manager who has worked at Microsoft for many years, has extensive experience in distributed systems, platform and frame development, cloud software, and e-commerce*)
> "When you are stuck in a traffic jam with a Porsche, all you do is burn more gas in idle. Scalability is about building wider roads, not about building faster cars."

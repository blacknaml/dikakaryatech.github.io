**Cem Kaner – James Bach – Bret Pettichord** (*Co-authors of the book “Lessons Learned in Software Testing” (2002), which brings an innovative perspective to the assumptions about software testing*)

> "Testers don’t like to break things; they like to dispel the illusion that things work."


**Chad Fowler** (*A software developer, trainer, manager, investor, speaker, author, co-organizer of Ruby conferences such as “The International Ruby Conference” and “RailsConf”*)

> "Because we all make mistakes, we also know that everyone else makes mistakes. So, within reason, we don’t judge each other on the mistakes we make. We judge each other on how we deal with those inevitable mistakes."
> 
> "You don’t win a race by trying not to lose."
>
> "The easiest way to never get anything done is to never commit to anything."
>
> "Concepts and patterns that your brain is sorting through and making sense of are much more scalable and universal than any specific vendor’s technology."
>
> "The older I get, the more I realize the biggest problem to solve in tech is to get people to stop making things harder than they have to be."
> "You can’t creatively help a business until you know how it works."
>
> "Software development is both challenging and rewarding. It’s creative like an art-form, but (unlike art) it provides concrete,measurable value."


**Charles H. Ferguson** (*An American director, author and software entrepreneur.*)

> "Thus, writing a clever piece of code at works is one thing; designing something that can support a long-lasting business is quite another. Commercial software design and production is, or should be, a rigorous, capital-intensive activity."


**Chris Pine** (*The author of the book “Learn to Program”, where he teaches programming using Ruby software language*)

> "Programming isn’t about what you know; it’s about what you can figure out."


**Chris Sacca** (*An American venture investor, corporate advisor, entrepreneur, lawyer, as well as the owner of Lowercase Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in seed and early-stage technology companies in the U.S.*)

> "Simplicity is hard to build, easy to use, and hard to charge for. Complexity is easy to build, hard to use, and easy to charge for."


**Chris Wenham** (*Has 20+ years of software developer and manager career in different areas of the software and different technologies, known for his articles on Stack Overflow and Hacker Monthly*)

> "Any program that tries to be so generalized and configurable that it could handle any kind of task will either fall short of this goal, or will be horribly broken."


**Christopher Baus** (*An American software developer and engineering manager.*)

> "Software isn’t about methodologies, languages, or even operating systems. It is about working applications."


**Cyrille Martraire** (*Founder and partner at Arolla, the founder of the Paris Software Crafters community, a regular speaker at international conferences and the author of “Living Documentation: Continuous Knowledge Sharing by Design*)

> "Software development is all about knowledge and decision-making based on that knowledge, which in turn creates additional knowledge."


**Dan Bricklin** (*An American businessman and engineer.*)

> "Sometimes the idea behind a program is one small creative effort."


**Daniel T. Barry** (*An American electrical engineer, computer scientist, and retired NASA astronaut, specialized in artificial intelligence and robotics*)

> "There is never enough time to do it right, but there is always enough time to fix it or to do it over."


**Daniel M. Berry** (*A professor in Computer Engineering at Waterloo University in Canada; has many published articles and books in software*)

> "A team of highly competent programmers who are also highly territorial, egotistical politicians will fail while a team of equally competent programmers, who are also egoless, cooperative, team players will succeed."


**Daniel Hillis** (*An American inventor, entrepreneur, and scientist, pioneered parallel computers and their use in the field of artificial intelligence, has over 300 published patents, is the author of the book “The Pattern on the Stone” published in 1998*)

> "The magic of a computer lies in its ability to become almost anything you can imagine, as long as you can explain exactly what that is."
> 
> "With the right programming, a computer can become a theater, a musical instrument, a reference book, a chess opponent. No other entity in the world except a human being has such an adaptable, universal nature."


**Danny Thorpe** (*An American programmer who is an expert in compiler and language design, object-oriented application architectures and platform infrastructure, primarily known for his work on Delphi*)

> "Programming without an overall architecture or design in mind is like exploring a cave with only a flashlight: You don’t know where you’ve been, you don’t know where you’re going, and you don’t know quite where you are."


**Dave Parnas** (*Considered as one of the pioneers of computer engineering in Canada, known for his significant contributions to the academic dissemination of computer engineering with more than 265 articles and reports he published*)

> "As a rule, software systems do not work well until they have been used, and have failed repeatedly, in real applications."
>
> "One bad programmer can easily create two new jobs a year."


**Dave Thomas** (*A computer programmer, writer, and publisher; co-author of the book “The Pragmatic Programmer” and co-founder of the publishing house “Pragmatic Bookshelf” with Andy Hunt*)

> "Write shy code – modules that don’t reveal anything unnecessary to other modules and that don’t rely on other modules’ implementations."
> 
> "When you come across a stumbling block because the code doesn’t quite fit anymore, or you notice two things that should really be merged, or anything else at all strikes you as being “wrong”, don’t hesitate to change it. There’s no time like the present."


**David Heinemeier Hansson** (*A Danish programmer, the creator of Ruby on Rails, co-founder and CTO of Basecamp, co-author of five books including best-sellers such as “Rework” and “It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work*)

> "You can’t learn everything. You can’t hold every concept fully expanded in your head. And moreover, you shouldn’t. As we compress formerly fundamental concepts, we make room for new, grander abstractions."


**David Wheeler** (*A computer scientist and a computer science professor at the Cambridge University*)

> "Compatibility means deliberately repeating other people’s mistakes."


**Dennis Ritchie** (*An American computer scientist.*)

> "Computer science research is different from these more traditional disciplines. Philosophically it differs from the physical sciences because it seeks not to discover, explain, or exploit the natural world, but instead to study the properties of machines of human creation. In this it as analogous to mathematics, and indeed the “science” part of computer science is, for the most part mathematical in spirit. But an inevitable aspect of computer science is the creation of computer programs: objects that, though intangible, are subject to commercial exchange."


**Donald Knuth** (*A computer scientist and the author of the book “The Art of Computer Programming”*)

> "People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on eachother, like a wall of mini stones."
> 
> "Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do."
> 
> "Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, and it requires skill and ingenuity, A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist will enjoy what he does and will do it better."
> 
> "Always remember, that there’s usually a simpler and better way to do something than the first way that pops into your head."


**Donald Norman** (*An American researcher, professor and author.*)

> "Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding."


**Donald G. Reinertsen** (*Founder of Reinertsen & Associates and author of “Managing the Design Factory“, “The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean Product Development“ and “Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business*)

> "To manage product development effectively, we must recognize that valuable new information is constantly arriving throughout the development cycle. Rather than remaining frozen in time, locked to our original plan, we must learn to make good economic choices using this emerging information."


**Doug Linder** (*An electrical and computer engineering professor at the Virginia Tech Engineering Faculty*)

> "A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street."


**Douglas Adams** (*A British science fiction author, a comic radio dramatist, and a musician; best known as the author of “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” series*)

> "I am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand."


**Douglas Crockford** (*American computer programmer involved in the development of the JavaScript language.*)

> "We see a lot of feature-driven product design in which the cost of features is not properly accounted. Features can have a negative value to customers because they make the products more difficult to understand and use. We are finding that people like products that just work. It turns out that designs that just work are much harder to produce that designs that assemble long lists of features."
> 
> "Math is important to programming; but it is only one of many important things. If you place too much emphasis on things that may be more important, like literacy, you are not putting enough emphasis on it."
> 
> "By writing in a clear and consistent style, your programs become easier to read."

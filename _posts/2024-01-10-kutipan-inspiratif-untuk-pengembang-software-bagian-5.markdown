**Hans Hofmann** (*An American teacher and painter who embraced Abstract Expressionism.*)
> "The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak."


**Henry Petroski** (*An American civil engineer and professor of history at Duke University; has extensive writings on design, success and failure, engineering, and technology history*)
> "The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry."


**H. W. Kenton** (*A frequently referenced name in Ken Henderson’s “The Guru’s Guide to Transact-SQL” book. No other information was found about him.*)
> "While there is certainly an artistic element to engineering, nobody cares what color the bridge was that collapsed and killed fifty people."
> 
> "Good engineering is the difference between code running in eight minutes or eight hours. It affects real people in real ways. It’s not a “matter of opinion.” any more than a bird taking a flight is a “matter of opinion."


**Hyrum Wright** (*He is a software engineer at Google.*)
> "With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody."


**Ilan Goldstein** (*A world-renowned Certified Scrum Trainer with extensive experience working with start-ups, market leaders and public companies to increase their agility with Scrum and is the author of the book “Scrum Shortcuts Without Cutting Corners”*)
> "Scrum without automation is like driving a sports car on a dirt track – you won’t experience the full potential, you will get frustrated, and you will probably end up blaming the car."


**James Gosling** (*A Canadian computer scientist, often referred to as “Dr. Java”, known as the founder and chief designer of the Java programming language. When Gosling realized that the electronic device embedded system project he started designing with C ++ was getting cumbersome, he started working on Java taking the best features of C ++ to create a user-friendly programming language; with less complex syntax.*)
> "Java is C++ without the guns, knives, and clubs."


**James Whittaker** (*An American software tester, creator of the unFIX model, entrepreneur, and author of “How Google Tests Software”, “The 7 Stages of Creativity: Developing Your Creative Self”, “Exploratory Software Testing”*)
> "Small tests lead to code quality. Medium and large tests lead to product quality."


**Jef Raskin** (*An American human-computer interface expert known for designing and launching the Macintosh project at Apple in the late 70s, the author of the book “The Humane Interface”*)
> "The place to start the implementation is to list exactly what the user will do to achieve his or her goals and how the system will respond to each user action."
> 
> "If our field is ‘to advance’, we must – without displacing creativity and aesthetics – make sure our terminology is clear."
>
> "A well-designed and humane interface does not have to be split into beginner and expert subsystems."
> 
> "An interface is humane if it is responsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties."


**Jeff Atwood** (*An American software developer and writer, also co-founder of Stack Overflow and owner of the programming blog “Coding Horror”*)
> "The best reaction to “this is confusing, where are the docs” is to rewrite the feature to make it less confusing, not write more docs."
> 
> "We have to stop optimizing for programmers and start optimizing for users."


**Jeff Bezos** (*An American internet entrepreneur, industrialist, media proprietor, and investor, best known as the founder and CEO of Amazon*)
> "If your customer base is aging with you, then eventually you are going to become obsolete or irrelevant. You need to be constantly figuring out who are your new customers and what are you doing to stay forever young."
> 
> "If you’re going to do anything new or innovative, you have to be willing to be misunderstood."
> 
> "If you’re competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something. Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering."


**Jeff Sutherland** (*A software developer and one of the creators of the Scrum software development process, known as “Father of Scrum.” He contributed to the writing of the “Agile Manifesto” in 2001 and is the author of the “Scrum Guide.”*)
> "Scrum is like the rules of soccer. Following them does not make you a good player."


**Jeff Weiner** (*The CEO of Linkedin*)
> "Almost without exception, the best products are developed by teams with desire to solve a problem; not a company’s need to fulfill a strategy."


**Jeremy Keith** (*A web developer, musician and author.*)
> "Remember, the web isn’t about control. If a visitor to your site is familiar with using a browser’s native form doodad, you won’t be doing them any favors if you override the browser functionality with your own widget, even if you think your widget looks better."


**Jessica Gaston**
> "One man’s crappy software is another man’s full time job."


**Jessica Kerr** (*A software developer, blogger and event speaker; currently works as DevOps and agile transformation consultant*)
> "A Fallacy of Software: If it works, and we don’t change anything, it will keep working."


**Jez Humble** (*American code, infrastructure and product developer, author.*)
> "There are two rules of thumb architects follow when decomposing systems. First, ensure that adding a new feature tends to change only one service or a component at a time. This reduces interface churn.6 Second, avoid “chatty” or fine-grained communication between services. Chatty services scale poorly and are harder to impersonate for testing purposes."


**Jim Highsmith** (*An American software engineer, author of many books on software development methodology, one of those who signed the “Agile Manifesto” and creator of the Adaptive Software Development concept*)
> "The best way to get a project done faster is to start sooner."
> 
> "If we want to build great products, we need great people. If we want to attract and keep great people, we need great principles."
> 
> "In high-performance teams, the leaders managed the principles, and the principles managed the team."
> 
> "Agility is more attitude than process, more environment than methodology."
> 
> "Simple rules guide innovative, intelligent responses. Comprehensive rules guide rote, routine responses."
> 
> "The quality of results from any collaboration effort are driven by trust and respect."
> 
> "Agile development reflects a product lifecycle approach, rather than a project approach."


**Jim McCarthy** (*An author, keynote speaker, co-creator of Core Protocols with Michele McCarthy, author of “Software for Your Head” and “Dynamics of Software Development” and has a patent on instant messaging. Worked at Bell Laboratories, Whitewater Group, and Microsoft*)
> "You can’t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families."


**Joel Goldberg** (*An American software developer.*)
> "Teams move at the speed of trust. Be the kind of dependable person you would want to work with."


**Joel Spolsky** (*An American software engineer and author*)
> "We’re programmers. Programmers are, in their hearts, architects, and the first thing they want to do when they get to a site is to bulldoze the place flat and build something grand. We’re not excited by incremental renovation: tinkering, improving, planting flower beds."


**John Backus** (*An American computer scientist, led the team that created the FORTRAN, the inventor of the Backus-Naur form (BNF), developed the functional programming language “FP”, which advocated a mathematical approach to programming. In 1994, he received the Draper Award.*)
> "I myself have had many failures and I’ve learned that if you are not failing a lot, you are probably not being as creative as you could be, you aren’t stretching your imagination enough."


**John Carmack** (*A computer programmer, video game developer, and engineer; led the team developing games such as Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake*)
> "Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something to a fellow programmer doesn’t take it away from you."
> 
> "The cost of adding a feature isn’t just the time it takes to code it. The cost also includes the addition of an obstacle to future expansion. The trick is to pick the features that don’t fight each other."
> 
> "Focus is a matter of deciding what things you’re not going to do."
> 
> "Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and just keep taking the next step towards completing it. If you aren’t sure which way to do something, do it both ways and see which works better."


**John Cutler** (*Started his career as a game developer, specialized in product management, accepted as an opinion leader in product management, his articles published in many different sources, known with the article “50 Things I’ve Learned About Product Management”*)
> "You tend to go where you look. If you look too hard at the competition you’ll go towards them, instead of towards point ahead of them."
> 
> "If in doubt, get out of your head and gather data. Build something and test. Same goes with meetings where there is endless conjecture. Have a bias for action!"
> 
> "All bets are off until someone is trying to use the feature with their data, in their environment, in their day to day work. You have to leave time to iterate based on that feedback."
> 
> "Trying to land a 747 on a speedboat is never a good idea. Work in small batches, and plan at the last responsible moment."
> 
> "Driving out all uncertainty tends to drive out originality (and innovation)."
> 
> "Passing the trash to other departments (e.g. “support will deal with it”) always comes back to bite you."
> 
> "Without a strong product vision, you’ll end up outsourcing product strategy to the rest of the company."


**John Johnson**
> "First solve the problem then write the code."


**John Maeda** (*An American executive, designer and technologist.*)
> "Simplicity is about the unexpected pleasure derived from what is likely to be insignificant and would otherwise go unnoticed."


**John Ousterhout** (*An American computer science professor and author.*)
> "Your job as a developer is not just to create code that you can work with easily, but to create code that others can also work with easily."
> 
> "You’ll end up with a much better result if you consider multiple options for each major design decision."


**John Romero** (*An American director, designer, programmer and developer working in the gaming industry; co-founder of the company that created games such as Wolfenstein 3D, Dangerous Dave, Hexen, Doom, Doom II, and Quake, and the designer of the games*)
> "You might not think that programmers are artists, but programming is an extremely creative profession. It’s logic-based creativity."


**John Warnock** (*An American computer scientist and business person, invented the PostScript language, best known as the co-founder of Adobe Systems Inc., pioneered the development of graphics, publishing, web and electronic document technologies that have revolutionized the field of publishing and visual communications*)
> "It’s very important that a programmer be able to look at a piece of code like a bad chapter of a book and scrap it without looking back. Never get too enamored with one idea, never hang onto anything tenaciously without being able to throw it away when necessary; that should be the programmer’s attitude."
> 
> "Learn from small experiments rather than large ones. Don’t go into a two-year development with nothing coming out in the middle. Have something come out every two months, so you can evaluate, regroup, and restart."
> 
> "To be successful, you want to surround yourself with very talented folks whose skills blend very well. That’s the secret of success."


**John F. Woods** (*A game programmer, no information was found other than the email he sent to the comp.lang.c ++ newsgroup in September 1991.*)
> "Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live."


**Joshua Bloch** (*An American software engineer, published many books on Java including “Effective Java”, led the design and implementation of numerous Java platform features, including the Java Collections Framework, the java.math package, and the assert mechanism.*)
> "When you choose a language, you’re choosing more than a set of technical trade-offs-you’re choosing a community."

**Kathryn Barrett** (*Self-taught coder since the age of 12, now teaches coding to children in Canada at Learning Labs – the institution that promotes organizations such as Learning Learning Code, Girls Learning Code, Kids Learning Code, and HackerYou.*)
> "Falling in love with code means falling in love with problem solving and being a part of a forever ongoing conversation. To be a computer programmer does not mean to live in isolation and solitude, but rather the exact opposite."


**Karolina Szczur** (*A designer and front-end developer, wrote the article “On writing maintainable front-end systems” in 2015.*)
> "Writing software as if we are the only person that ever has to comprehend it is one of the biggest mistakes and false assumptions that can be made."


**Kelsey Hightower** (*A strong open source advocate, has worn every hat possible from technical support to software development or system administration, and has held various leadership roles throughout his career in technology, currently works as a “Staff Developer Advocate” at Google Cloud*)
> "Maintaining an open-source project is like being a flight attendant for an airline where all tickets are free and the majority of customer surveys offer suggestions on how to fly the airplane."


**Kent Beck** (*An American software engineer, creator of the agile software development methodology “Extreme Programming”, one of the 17 original signatories of “Agile Manifesto” and a pioneer of the software design patterns*)
> "I’m not a great programmer; I’m just a good programmer with great habits."
> 
> "The craft of programming begins with empathy, not formatting or languages or tools or algorithms or data structures."
> 
> "Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment."
> 
> "Tests are the Programmer’s stone, transmuting fear into boredom."
> 
> "Everything in software changes. The requirements change. The design changes. The business changes. The technology changes. The team changes. The team members change. The problem isn’t change, because change is going to happen; the problem, rather, is our inability to cope with change."
> 
> "Readers need to understand programs in detail and in concept. Sometimes they move from detail to concept, sometimes from concept to detail."

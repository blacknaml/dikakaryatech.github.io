**Edsger W. Dijkstra** (*A Dutch system scientist, computer scientist, and writer; known for “Dijkstra’s algorithm”, received the Turing Award in 1972*)
> "Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward."
>
> "Perfecting oneself is as much unlearning as it is learning."
> 
> "The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull. He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and avoids clever tricks like the plague."
> 
> "We shall do a much better programming job, provided that we approach the task with a full appreciation of its tremendous difficulty, provided that we stick to modest and elegant programming languages, provided that we respect the intrinsic limitations of the human mind and approach the task as Very Humble Programmers."
> 
> "If we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as “lines produced” but as “lines spent."
> 
> "Besides a mathematical inclination, an exceptionally good mastery of one’s native tongue is the most vital asset of a competent programmer."
> 
> "I mean, if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and dirty, you suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and say to yourself “Dijkstra would not have liked this”, well, that would be enough immortality for me."
>
> "We have to fight chaos, and the most effective way of doing that is to prevent its emergence."
> 
> "The tools we use have a profound and devious influence on our thinking habits, and therefore on our thinking abilities."
> 
> "Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard work and discipline."


**Elisabeth Hendrickson** (*Founder of Quality Tree Software, Inc.’in, tester and developer.*)
> "I’ve had successes and failures with test automation. My greatest successes came from having an effective strategy for using the tools at my disposal. My worst failure was a result of assuming we needed to “automate everything.”"


**Elizabeth Zwicky** (*A Unix system administrator specializing in security and system abuse, has worked as an anti-spam architect at Yahoo for many years, is the co-author of the book “Building Internet Firewalls”*)
> "The only thing more frightening than a programmer with a screwdriver or a hardware engineer with a program is a user with a pair of wire cutters and the root password."


**Elon Musk** (*An entrepreneur, businessman, founder, CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX.*)
> "If you also think technology just automatically gets better every year but it actually doesn’t. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That’s how any technology actually gets better. And by itself technology…if people don’t work on it, it actually will decline."


**Eric Evans** (*A thought leader in software design and domain modeling and is the founder and author of Domain Language.*)
> "Success comes in an emerging set of abstract concepts that makes sense of all the detail. This distillation is a rigorous expression of the particular knowledge that has been found most relevant."
>
> "Contributing to open source projects is a great way to practice."


**Eric S. Raymond** (*An American software developer and open source advocate, has many published books, including “The Cathedral & the Bazaar,” which explains how to run an open-source project*)
> "Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging."
>
> "Every good work of software starts by scratching a developers personal itch."


**Federico Toledo** (*A Uruguayan computer engineer progressed in the field of quality engineering after doing a doctorate on testing, focuses on performance testing, test automation, and functional testing, has a book published in Spanish*)
> "Any optimization that is not about the bottleneck is an illusion of improvement."


**Felix von Leitner** (*A German IT security expert living in Berlin, nicknamed FeFe, the principal author of the dietlibc, a C standard library, has a personal blog with broad media coverage in Germany*)
> "If the data structure can’t be explained on a beer coaster, it’s too complex."


**Filipe Fortes** (*An entrepreneur and computer scientist specializing in HTML / JavaScript, layout algorithms, browser technologies, interaction design, and project management*)
> "Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer."


**Fred Brooks** (*A system architect, computer engineer, and computer scientist, the author of “The Mythical Man-Month”, which has been recognized by many as the holy book of software*)
> "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."
>
> "Good features and ideas that do not integrate with a system’s basic concepts are best left out"
> 
> "Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program."
> 
> "Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious."
> 
> "You can learn more from failure than success. In failure you’re forced to find out what part did not work. But in success you can believe everything you did was great, when in fact some parts may not have worked at all. Failure forces you to face reality."


**Fred Heath** (*Specialized in Ruby, Nim, Elixir, agile methodologies, meta-programming, behavior-oriented development, concept networks, worked at every stage of the software development life cycle, currently works as a freelance full-stack software developer, writes blog posts and lectures at conferences*)
> "Memory leaks are like water leaks: they happen when you least expect it, take hours to locate and make you wish you had spent more time protecting your valuables."


**Glenford J. Myers** (*An American computer scientist, entrepreneur, author of eight textbooks on computer science, made important contributions to microprocessor architecture*)
> "We try to solve the problem by rushing through the design process so that enough time is left at the end of the project to uncover the errors that were made because we rushed through the design process."


**Grace Hopper** (*One of the first computer programmers to work on the Harvard Mark I project, considered a pioneer in the field of computer science, worked as a brigade in the American Navy, known for helping develop COBOL, recording the first real “bug” and inventing the first compiler*)
> "The most dangerous phrase in the language is: We’ve always done it this way. I am now going to make you a gift that will stay with you the rest of your life. For the rest of your life, every time you say, “We’ve always done it that way,” my ghost will appear and haunt you for twenty-four hours."


**Grady Booch** (*An American software engineer, mostly known for developing Unified Modeling Language (UML). He has gained international recognition with his innovative work in software architecture, software engineering, and collaborative development environments*)
> "Good people with a good process will outperform good people with no process every time."
>
> "The amateur software engineer is always in search of magic, some sensational method or tool whose application promises to render software development trivial. It is the mark of the professional software engineer to know that no such panacea exist."
> 
> "The task of the software development team is to engineer the illusion of simplicity."


**Greg McKeown** (*A British public speaker, leadership and business strategist, and the author of “Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less”, “Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter” and “Effortless: Make It Easier to Do What Matters Most”*)
> "Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential."


**Guido Van Rossum** (*The creator of the Python programming language*)
> "Python is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and nobody can read another’s code; too little and expressiveness is endangered."
>
> "Invariably, you’ll find that if the language is any good, your users are going to take it to places where you never thought it would be taken."


**Gordon Bell** (*An MIT graduate engineer and pioneer in making the first mini-computers in the world*)
> "Every big computing disaster has come from taking too many ideas and putting them in one place."

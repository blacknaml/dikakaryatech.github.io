Di blog ini, kami mengumpulkan kata-kata inspiratif dalam bahasa Inggris yang kami anggap bijaksana dan masih dapat diterapkan. Kutipan kata-kata ini dari orang-orang yang terkenal dan diterima di berbagai bidang industri software.

**Tim Berner-Lee** (*A British computer scientist, professor, author and inventor of World Wide Web.*)
> "The web is more a social creation than a technical one. I designed it for a social effect – to help people work together – and not as a technical toy."


**Thomas C. Gale** (*An American car designer known for his work with Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth*)
> "Good design adds value faster than it adds cost."


**Tom Cargill** (*Known in the field of object-oriented programming and the “90–90 rule”. Worked extensively on debuggers written in C ++, and is the author of the book “C ++ Programming Style.” Offers consulting services to companies and technology courses and workshops on C ++, Java, XML, and OOP*)
> "The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time."


**Tom DeMarco** (*An American software engineer and also works as a software engineering consultant.*)
> "The manager’s function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work."
>
> "First law of Bad Management: If something isn’t working, do more of it."
> 
> "Computer system analysis is like child-rearing; you can do grievous damage, but you cannot ensure success."
>
> "Quality, far beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity."
> 
> "The business we’re in is more sociological than technological, more dependent on workers’ abilities to communicate with each other than their abilities to communicate with machines."
>
> "Successful change can only come in the context of a clear understanding of what may never change, what the organization stands for."


**Tom Gilb** (*An American systems engineer, consultant, and author, known for the development of software metrics, software inspection, and evolutionary processes, which was a forerunner of agile software development methods*)
> "At the source of every error which is blamed on the computer, you will find at least two human errors, one of which is the error of blaming it on the computer."


**Tom Love** (*A computer scientist with a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science at the University of Washington, the author of the book “Object Lessons: Lessons Learned in Object-Oriented Development” on OOP, and one of the creators of Objective-C*)
> "The key to efficient development is to ‘make interesting new mistakes."


**Tom Van Vleck** (*An American computer engineer with BA in mathematics from MIT, participated in Project MAC, which is the origin of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence*)
> "When somebody begins a sentence with “It would be nice if…” the right thing to do is to wait politely for the speaker to finish. No project ever gets around to the it-would-be-nice features: or it they do, they regret it. Wait for sentences that begin “We have to…” and pay close attention, and see if you agree."


**Tommy Collison** (*A writer and journalist, works as a manager at Lambda School, which teaches software development and coding online.*)
> "The best learners are the people who push through the discomfort of being objectively bad at something."


**Tony Hoare** (*A British computer scientist who made fundamental contributions to programming languages, algorithms, operating systems, formal verification and concurrent computing.*)
> "There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies."


**Vaughn Vernon** (*A veteran software craftsman and thought leader in simplifying software design and implementation. *)
> "Developers are too wrapped up with technology and trying to solve problems using technology rather than careful thought and design. This leads developers to constantly chase after new “shiny objects,” which are the latest fads in technology."


**W. Edwards Deming** (*An American engineer, statistician, professor, author, lecturer, and management consultant; best known for his work in Japan after World War II*)
> "Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion."


**Ward Cunningham** (*An American computer programmer, a pioneer in design patterns and extreme programming, developed the first Wiki, and co-authored the Agile Manifesto*)
> "The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it’s to post the wrong answer."
>
> "It was a turning point in my programming career when I realized that I didn’t have to win every argument. I’d be talking about code with someone, and I’d say, “I think the best way to do it is A.” And they’d say, “I think the best way to do it is B. I’d say, “Well no, it’s really A.” And they’d say, “Well, we want to do B.” It was a turning point for me when I could say, “Fine. Do B. It’s not going to hurt us that much if I’m wrong. It’s not going to hurt us that much if I’m right and you do B, because, we can correct mistakes. So lets find out if it’s a mistake."
> 
> "Putting a new feature into a program is important, but refactoring so new features can be added in the future is equally important."
>
> "Over and over, people try to design systems that make tomorrow’s work easy. But when tomorrow comes it turns out they didn’t quite understand tomorrow’s work, and they actually made it harder."


**Wietse Venema** (*A Dutch programmer and physicist, best known for writing the Postfix e-mail system and Coroner’s Toolkit*)
> "When I write software, I know that it will fail, either due to my own mistake, or due to some other cause."


**Yegor Bugayenko** (*A Russian programmer, entrepreneur, investor, and open source advocate, known for his book “Code Ahead” and blog posts, has created some patented methodologies such as PDD*)
> "Quality must be enforced, otherwise it won’t happen. We programmers must be required to write tests, otherwise we won’t do it."
>
> "Being a senior developer doesn’t mean getting a large salary or being appreciated in the office. It means belonging to an elite group of developers who know how to do certain things and can do them."
> 
> "The higher the price of information in a software team, the less effective the team is."
>
> "We must not blame programmers for their bugs. They belong to them only until the code is merged to the repository. After that, all bugs are ours!"
>
> "Punishment demotivates when it comes from people rather than a system of well-defined rules."
>
> "Any software project must have a technical leader, who is responsible for all technical decisions made by the team and have enough authority to make them. Responsibility and authority are two mandatory components that must be present in order to make it possible to call such a person an architect."


**Anonymous – Boston Computer Museum** (*Boston Computer Museum*)
> "Debugging is anticipated with distaste, performed with reluctance, and bragged about forever."

 Voice over Internet Protocol [VoIP][voip-ref] is a new way to talk on your phone through your broadband internet connection. A VoIP router is needed to help you use the same phone you have been using before your VoIP connection. If you have voice over internet protocol available to you, you'll need a router to sort of make it all happen. It's a small device that will take a little time to get used to, but once you've used it just a couple times you'll be able to use the whole system without a second thought.

Without a VoIP router your phone will not be able to figure out where datagrams should go from source to destination, so information will be lost. Routers will help control phone traffic, controls and maintains bandwidth, and ensures a good voice quality for each and every phone call. Basically, router is responsible for routing all the information in and out of your home so that you can get the services you are supposed to get.

It's said that because of ever expanding technology that VoIP routers won't be needed for much longer. With the invention of digital telephones the need for a separate router won't be necessary. But, until this newer technology becomes more widespread and cost efficient, the majority of VoIP users will need a router to use the voice over internet protocol features. Because of this newer technology, having VoIP service will become easier and more accessible to everyone in the very near future. But, don't let the idea of a routing device scare you off, as VoIP is very easy to use!

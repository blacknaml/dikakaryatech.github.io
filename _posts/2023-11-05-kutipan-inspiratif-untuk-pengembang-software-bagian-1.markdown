Di blog ini, kami mengumpulkan kata-kata inspiratif dalam bahasa Inggris yang kami anggap 
bijaksana dan masih dapat diterapkan. Kutipan kata-kata ini dari orang-orang yang terkenal dan 
diterima di berbagai bidang industri software. 

Pada bagian-1 ini akan diambil dari: Aaron Levie, Akshat Paul, Alan Cooper, Alan Kay, Alan Perlis, 
Alan Turing, Albert Einstein, Alex Engelberg, Aldous Huxley, Alistair Cockburn, Amir Ghahrai, 
Andrew Clark, Andrew Singer, Andy Hunt, Achibald Putt, Arthur C. Clarke, Atli Bjorgvin Oddson.

**Aaron Levie** (*An American entrepreneur, co-founder and CEO of a corporate cloud company*)
```
"Start with something simple and small, then expand over time. If people call it a ‘toy’ you’re 
definitely onto something."
"If you’re waiting for encouragement from others, you’re doing it wrong. By the time people think 
an idea is good, it’s probably too late."

```

**Akshat Paul** (*A software developer and writer*)
```
"User interface is the process of shifting from chaotic complexity to elegant simplicity."
```

**Alan Cooper** (*An American programmer and software designer, known as the father of Visual Basic*)
```
"If we want users to like our software, we should design it to behave like a likeable person."
"Define what the product will do before you design how the product will do it."
"Usability’s strength is in identifying problems, while design’s strength is in identifying solutions."
```

**Alan Kay** (*An American computer scientist known for his pioneering work in PC, object-oriented programming and GUI design*)
```
"The best way to predict the future is to invent it."
"Every technology really needs to be shipped with a special manual – not how to use it but why, when and for what."
```

**Alan Perlis** (*An American computer scientist and professor, known for his groundbreaking work on programming languages ​​and also the first winner of the Turing Award*)
```
"A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing."
"Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it."
"If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise of programs!"

```

**Alan Turing** (*A famous British mathematician, computer scientist, cryptologist, considered as the founder of computer science, laid the conceptual foundation of modern computers with the Turing machine, Turing Award, accepted the Nobel of computer science, is given annually in his name*)
```
"A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human."
```

**Albert Einstein** (*German theoretical physicist who has Nobel Prize*)
```
"A new idea comes suddenly and in a rather intuitive way, but intuition is nothing but the outcome of earlier intellectual experience."
```

**Alex Engelberg** (*A software engineer, also a musician and producer, known for his musical comedies on TikTok*)
```
"Programming is just saying 'I have a meeting in an hour so better not start on this yet' to yourself until you die."
```

**Aldous Huxley** (*A British writer and philosopher, has about fifty books in novel and non-fiction genres, including “Brave New World” which is considered a major example of the dystopia genre*)
```
"Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards."
```

**Alistair Cockburn** (*American computer scientist, author and known as one of the initiators of the agile movement in software development*)
```
"A well-functioning team of adequate people will complete a project almost regardless of the process or technology they are asked to use (although the process and technology may help or hinder them along the way.)"
```

**Amir Ghahrai** (*A frontend developer on Facebook React Core team*)
```
"In programming, if someone tells you “you’re overcomplicating it,” they’re either 10 steps behind you or 10 steps ahead of you."
```

**Andrew Singer** (*A professor of electrical and computer engineering and Vice Dean of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the University of Illinois, with the primary research area signal processing*)
```
"The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do."
```

**Andy Hunt** (*A computer programmer, writer, one of the 17 original authors of Agile Manifesto one of the founders of Agile Alliance, and co-author of “The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master” with Dave Thomas*)
```
"No one in the brief history of computing has ever written a piece of perfect software. It’s unlikely that you’ll be the first."
"All software you write will be tested—if not by you and your team, then by the eventual users—so you might as well plan on testing it thoroughly."
"One hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as archaic as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today’s civil engineers, while our craftsmanship will still be honored."
"We can be proud of our abilities, but we must own up to our shortcomings, our ignorances and our mistakes."
"There is no such thing as a best solution, be it a tool, a language, or an operating system. There can only be systems that are more appropriate in a particular set of circumstances."
"Great software today is often preferable to perfect software tomorrow. If you give your users something to play with early, their feedback will often lead you to a better eventual solution."
"Developers who don’t actively think about their code are programming by coincidence—the code might work, but there’s no particular reason why."
"One broken window — a badly designed piece of code, a poor management decision that the team must live with for the duration of the project — is all it takes to start the decline. 
If you find yourself working on a project with quite a few broken windows, it’s all too easy to slip into the mindset of ‘All the rest of this code is crap, I’ll just follow suit.’”
"While software development is immune from almost all physical laws, entropy hits us hard."
"In an abstract sense, an application is successful if it correctly implements its specifications. Unfortunately, this pays only abstract bills. 
In reality, the success of a project is measured by how well it meets the expectations of its users."

```

**Archibald Putt** (*The author of the book “Putt’s Law and Successful Technocrat”, nicknamed Archibald Putt*)
```
"Technology is dominated by two types of people, those who understand what they do not manage and those who manage what they do not understand."
```

**Arthur C. Clarke** (*An English science-fiction writer, science writer, and futurist, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host, co-writer of the screenplay for the 1968 film “2001: A Space Odyssey”, one of the most influential films of all time, and the creator of “Clarke’s Laws”*)
```
"When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong."
```

**Atli Björgvin Oddsson** (*An Icelandic software developer, software architect, and entrepreneur working at NASDAQ*)
```
"If you don’t hear any complaints from users, they are not using the software – or your support email is broken."
```
